(1) Performs Person's tasks
(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor
(3) Performs Employee's tasks
(4) Performs Faculty's tasks

Te program produces the preceding output. Why?.

New Faculty() invokes Faculty's no-arg constructor.
Since Faculty is a subclass of Employee,
Employee's no-arg constructor is invoked before any statements in Faculty's constructor are excecuted
Employee's no-arg constructor invokes Employee's second constructor (with parameter String)
Since Employee is a subclass of Person,
Person's no-arg constructor is invoked before any statements in Employee's second constructor are executed.
