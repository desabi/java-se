* A method can be implemented in several classes along the inheritance chain.
* The JVM decides wich method is invoked at runtime. 
* A method can be defined in a superclass and be overridden in its subclass

* The toString() method is deifined in the Object class
  and overridden in GeometricObject


DECLARED TYPE = ACTUAL TYPE

Object o = new GeometricObject();
System.out.println(o.toString());

*Which toString() method is invoked by o?

*Lets introduce two terms: 
 1. declared type
 2. actual type

* A variable must be declared a type
* The type that declares a variable is called the variable's DECLARED TYPE
* Here, o's declared type is Object

* A variable of a reference type can hold a null value or a reference to an
  instance of the declared type
* The instance may be created using the constructor of the declared type or its subtype.

* The ACTUAL TYPE of the variable is the actual class for the object referenced by the variable.
* Here, oÂ´s actual type is GeometricObject, because o references an object created 
  using new GeometricObject. 

* Which toString() method is invoked by o is determined by o's ACTUAL TYPE.

* This is know as DINAMIC BINDING
